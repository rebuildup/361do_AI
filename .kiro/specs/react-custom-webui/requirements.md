# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在の Streamlit ベースの WebUI は制約が多く、実現したい UI デザインや機能が制限されています。Streamlit のエージェント連携機能を維持しながら、React + Tailwind CSS を使用した高度にカスタマイズ可能な WebUI への移行を実現します。これにより、より柔軟な UI 設計、優れたユーザーエクスペリエンス、そして将来的な拡張性を確保します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Streamlit to a React-based UI, so that I can create more flexible and customizable user interfaces without Streamlit's constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new React UI is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing agent communication functionality
2. WHEN users interact with the new UI THEN the system SHALL provide the same chat functionality as the current Streamlit version
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL no longer depend on Streamlit for the main UI
4. IF the React UI fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and responsive chat interface, so that I can interact with the AI agent seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a responsive design with main content area at 768px width
2. WHEN the side panel is open THEN the system SHALL allocate 288px width for the panel
3. WHEN the side panel is closed THEN the system SHALL allocate 48px width for the collapsed panel
4. WHEN screen width falls below 768+288px THEN the system SHALL automatically close the side panel
5. WHEN users send messages THEN the system SHALL provide real-time streaming responses with visual feedback
6. WHEN users view chat history THEN the system SHALL display messages in a clean, readable format with proper styling
7. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions without drop shadows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing agent backend functionality, so that the migration doesn't break the core AI processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React UI communicates with the backend THEN the system SHALL use the existing FastAPI gateway for API communication
2. WHEN agent processing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing self-learning capabilities
3. WHEN users interact with tools and features THEN the system SHALL preserve all current agent functionality including tool registry, prompt management, and reward calculation
4. IF backend communication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced UI features that weren't possible with Streamlit, so that I can have a better user experience with more intuitive controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the sidebar THEN the system SHALL provide smooth collapsible/expandable functionality following the breakpoint rules
2. WHEN users customize settings THEN the system SHALL offer advanced configuration options with immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN users view agent status THEN the system SHALL display real-time status updates with visual indicators
4. WHEN users access different features THEN the system SHALL provide tabbed or modal interfaces for better organization
5. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use Lucide icons instead of emojis
6. WHEN Lucide icons are not available THEN the system SHALL use Google Fonts theme icons as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper development and build setup for the React application, so that I can maintain and extend the UI efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide a modern React development setup with hot reloading
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized static assets that can be served efficiently
3. WHEN developing new features THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent and maintainable styling
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use yarn instead of npm for package management
6. WHEN organizing project structure THEN the system SHALL keep root folder files to the absolute minimum

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new UI to support all existing features, so that I don't lose any functionality during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access model selection THEN the system SHALL provide the same model switching capabilities as the current Streamlit version
2. WHEN users view agent metrics THEN the system SHALL display performance data, learning progress, and system status
3. WHEN users access configuration options THEN the system SHALL provide all current settings including streaming, creativity levels, and response quality
4. WHEN users interact with quick tools THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing tool functionality with improved UI presentation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the new UI to integrate seamlessly with the existing deployment setup, so that deployment and maintenance remain straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL work with the existing Docker setup and docker-compose configuration
2. WHEN serving the React UI THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing FastAPI backend without requiring separate servers
3. WHEN updating the application THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing configuration files and data structures
4. IF deployment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to follow consistent design principles, so that I have a cohesive and professional user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying colors THEN the system SHALL use #000000 as the base color for a monochrome dark theme
2. WHEN styling base elements THEN the system SHALL implement a monochrome color scheme with dark theme aesthetics
3. WHEN designing components THEN the system SHALL avoid using drop shadows
4. WHEN creating layouts THEN the system SHALL be mindful of grid systems and grid design principles
5. WHEN implementing panels THEN the system SHALL effectively incorporate components with transparent/semi-transparent areas and panel styles that create a sense of depth

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support natural language interactions for all agent functions, so that I can control the AI agent intuitively without learning specific commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users provide instructions THEN the system SHALL process natural language Japanese instructions through the WebUI
2. WHEN users request agent functions THEN the system SHALL support web search, command execution, file modification, and MCP usage through natural language
3. WHEN users interact with the agent THEN the system SHALL maintain indefinite conversations without clearing sessions
4. WHEN agents process requests THEN the system SHALL allow agents to rewrite their own custom prompts and manipulate their own tuning data
5. WHEN handling commands THEN the system SHALL rely on agents making judgments based on natural language instructions rather than word recognition
